main() function

    local variable...
    statements
    methods calls
    assembly code if aby
    .....
}

function1()
{
    local variable...
    statements
    methods calls
    assembly code if aby
    .........
}

function2()
{
    local variable...

    methods calls
    assembly code if aby
    .........
}

The Object Oriented concept are not here but idea is here.
